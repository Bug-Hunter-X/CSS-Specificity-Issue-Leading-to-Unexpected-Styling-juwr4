This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue related to specificity.  A more specific selector unintentionally overrides a more general one, leading to unexpected styling. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises because of the order of selectors and their specificity. The solution involves restructuring the selectors to ensure the desired styles are applied correctly.
